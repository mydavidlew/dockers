Install Docker & Docker Compose - Centos 7
https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/scratchpads2/wiki/Install-Docker-and-Docker-Compose-(Centos-7)

[Step 1 — Install Docker]
Install needed packages:
$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

Configure the docker-ce repo:
$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

Install docker-ce:
$ sudo yum install docker-ce
$ sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

Add your user to the docker group with the following command.
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)

Set Docker to start automatically at boot time:
$ sudo systemctl enable docker.service

Finally, start the Docker service:
$ sudo systemctl start docker.service

[Step 2 — Install Docker Compose]
Install Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux
$ sudo yum install epel-release

Install python-pip
$ sudo yum install -y python-pip

Then install Docker Compose:
$ sudo pip install docker-compose

You will also need to upgrade your Python packages on CentOS 7 to get docker-compose to run successfully:
$ sudo yum upgrade python*

To verify a successful Docker Compose installation, run:
$ docker-compose version

[Step 3 - Install Docker Compose (alternative)]
Before downloading the Compose binary visit the Compose repository release page on GitHub and check if there is a new version available for download (https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).
Start by downloading the Docker Compose binary into the /usr/bin directory using the following curl command:
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/bin/docker-compose

Once the download is complete, make the binary executable by typing:
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose

To verify the installation type the following command to print the Compose version:
$ docker-compose --version

[Step 4 - Install Docker Machine (alternative)]
Before downloading the Machine binary visit the Machine repository release page on GitHub and check if there is a new version available for download (https://github.com/docker/machine/releases).
Start by downloading the Docker Machine binary into the /usr/bin directory using the following curl command:
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.2/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/bin/docker-machine

Once the download is complete, make the binary executable by typing:
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-machine

To verify the installation type the following command to print the Compose version:
$ docker-machine --version
